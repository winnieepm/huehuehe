                <p><strong>Coasts in Crisis</strong> is a digital exhibit built on Drupal 9 that shares the art pieces made by 6 Caribbean artist during the 2017 hurricane season. Originally, Coasts in Crisis took place as an artists' gathering at the University of Virginia during the Spring of 2019. It was organized by Drs. Caroline Whitcomb and Charlotte Rogers.</p>

                <p>After the event's success, Dr. Rogers sought and received several grants to create a digital representation of the event that would provide longer-lasting access to some of the art pieces and ideas that were discussed during the in-person gathering.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">my role as research assistant: overview</h2>
                <p>In the spring of 2021, Dr. Charlotte Rogers hired me to work along with PhD student Elise Foote to develop a Drupal site. Elise had spent the previous year selecting and organizing the structure and content for the project. She created an instance of Drupal on Reclaim Hosting and needed help with debugging and web design.</p>

                <p>Once I became a member of the project, I took over the maintenance of the site and created a Bootsrap subtheme for the exhibit. I used Adobe Photoshop to design the main navigation on the home page and also to create mockups for all of the pages that would contain artwork.</p>

                <p> When Dr. Rogers approved the final designs, Elise and I worked together to upload and properly style all of the content. This second phase was a crucial one and certainly the most difficult. Neither Elise nor me had any previous experience working in Drupal, and thus it was a bumpy and steep, albeit engaging, learning curve.</p>

                <p>The exhibit had an official launch event via Zoom on October 12th, 2021, and it included the participation and first reactions of three of the featured artists. Elise, Dr. Rogers and I spent the spring of 2022 and the beginning of that summer preparing an essay about the project that is currently under revision by the editors of the <i>Archipelagos</i> journal, Alex Gil and Kaiama Glover.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">process & some results</h2>
                <p>In our meetings to discuss user experience, Dr. Rogers expressed an interest in including elements that would disorient visitors. She wanted the website to offer a non-traditional navigation experience, inspired by the principles of spiral-thinking and non-linearity that are frequently discussed in Caribbean studies. This experimental goal presented an important challenge both for shaping the flat, virtual format of the website and for us as first and foremost literary scholars who now had to conceive a visual landscape to fit our critical aspirations.
                </p>

                <p>To propose what became the official navigation design and structure, I drew from Elise's work on the site infrastructure in combination with my own knowledge about hurricanes as a person from the Caribbean. Elise and Dr. Rogers envisioned that three thematic pathways would be immediately available for site visitors to enjoy, but they wanted to erase any notions of hierarchy or ordering among the pathways. That is, the ideal output would invite readers to experience each and all thematic pathways in no particular order so as to elicit more potential interpretations.</p>
                
                <p>My response to this dilemma took the shape here below:</p>
