                <p><strong>Coasts in Crisis</strong> is a digital exhibit built on Drupal 9 that shares the art pieces that 6 Caribbean artist made during the 2017 hurricane season. Initially, Coasts in Crisis took place as an artists' gathering at the University of Virginia during the Spring of 2019. It was organized by Drs. Caroline Whitcomb and Charlotte Rogers.</p>

                <p>After the event's success, Dr. Rogers sought and received several grants to create a digital representation of the event that would provide longer-lasting access to some of the art pieces and ideas that were discussed during the in-person gathering.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">my role as research assistant</h2>
                <p>In the spring of 2021, Dr. Charlotte Rogers hired me to build the Drupal site with another PhD student, Elise Foote. Elise had spent the previous year developing the structure and content for the project. She created an instance of Drupal on Reclaim Hosting and needed help with debugging and web design.</p>

                <p>Once I became a member of the project, I took over the maintenance of the site and created a Bootsrap subtheme for the exhibit. I used Adobe Photoshop to design the home page navigation and also to create mockups for all of the pages that would contain artwork.</p>

                <p> When Dr. Rogers approved the final designs, Elise and I worked together to upload and properly style all of the content. This second phase was a crucial one and certainly the most difficult. Neither Elise nor me had any previous experience working in Drupal, and thus it was a bumpy and steep, albeit engaging, learning curve.</p>
